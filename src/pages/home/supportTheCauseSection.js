				As diversity fuels creativity and innovation, we here at SpaceLab strongly value the voices and
				perspectives of those underrepresented in the community. One of our goals is to create paid fellowships,
				internships, scholarship opportunities, and debt relief for those who are underrepresented, including
				but not limited to women, members of the LGBTQ+ community, and people of color. Helping members of the
				community who struggle economically will provide them with the liberty and flexibility necessary to
				explore new career paths in science and technology. To help us grow these opportunities, please consider
				making a tax-deductible donation to SpaceLab today.
