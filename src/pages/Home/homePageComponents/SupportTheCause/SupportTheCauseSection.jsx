					At Spacelab, we believe that diversity drives innovation and creativity, which is
					why we value the voices and perspectives of those underrepresented in the community.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our goal is to create paid fellowships, internships,
					scholarship opportunities, and provide debt relief to these
					underrepresented groups â€“ including women,
					members of the <span title="lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or questioning, intersex, and asexual">LGBTQ+</span> community, and people of color.
					Giving these groups financial support will afford them the opportunity
					to explore new career paths in science and technology.
				</p>
				<p>
					Help us achieve this goal by making a donation today!
