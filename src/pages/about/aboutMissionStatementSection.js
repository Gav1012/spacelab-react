							We value the voices of those too often talked over and under appreciated, because we firmly
							believe that a diverse group of people approaching a problem will arrive at a more creative
							and unique solution; a solution that incorporates each individual's perspectives, values,
							and needs. We aim to operate from a starting point of equity, inclusion and belonging.
